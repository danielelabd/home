      <p><span class="first-character sc">W</span>heelchair users make up 1% of the global population. The increased social awareness of immobile individuals across the past century has driven engineers into creating the adaptable wheelchair design seen in the present day. Technology advances have brought about the increased integration of wheelchair users into society by providing support; in completing daily tasks and in participating in specific leisure activities, however, the majority of water activities remain inaccessible.
Therefore, a design opportunity was recognised which subsequently fuelled this study in creating the FloBoat, a wheelchair that provides support to individuals when in the water and on the beach. The FloBoat journeyed through a rigorous design approach, fulfilling the necessary design requirements to operate with maximum functionality and effectiveness. Throughout the design analysis, investigations were completed on design tasks such as material selection, hydrostatics and stability.
Finite Element Analysis alongside a material selection database, GRANTA EduPack, deduced component materials and a suitable fibre layup for the CFRP-based chair body.</p>
      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
      <p class="margin-top-10">The FloBoat demonstrated the ability to float and achieved an average draft of 659mm at 26.4° from the base. Stability in water was additionally attained when the metacentric height of the final design was calculated to be 0.0014m indicating initial device stability. The final design was created as a Computer-Aided Design model. Manufacturing and business plans were subsequently compiled to assess the financial feasibility of the FloBoat. The pricing model achieved a healthy gross margin averaging to 67.8% leading to 5-year projections that indicate a breakeven point in the first operating year after 146 sales. This design study has fashioned an economical device that can effectively support immobile individuals in enjoying the water whilst maintaining health, safety and durability standards.</p>

      <p><span class="first-character ny">H</span>Half of the plastic that has ever been generated has been produced in the last 13 years. If these recent trends continue, it is estimated that 26 billion tons of plastic will be produced in the next 30 years. To reduce these environmental impacts the radical way of thinking needs to be changed, by optimising the use of this material and increasing its life cycle through reuse and recycling [1]. Statistics show that 15% of waste that arrive at recycling plants are non-recyclable or highly contaminated [2]. Thus, making it difficult for waste management facilities to be accurate during the recycling process, which results in wasting time, money, and labor.
Promoting proper waste management, by combining education models and appropriate technologies, is a key contribution to sustainable development. The aim of the project is to overcome these difficulties by developing a self-sorting machine with the implementation of artificial intelligence. The goal is to separate recyclables from non-recyclables, thus preventing the presences of unwanted waste at recycling plants beforehand.
Once the purpose and design of the product was chosen, a questionnaire was conducted for primary research regarding the potential market of the automatic recycling bin. The research concluded that Universities are the best potential market for the sorting machine as on average Universities in the UK spend £250,000 a year on waste management and a potential market size of £1.08 million was estimated.
Simple Sorting was designed, developed and tested by group Pangea according to the Universities needs and demands by incorporating Google Cloud Vision API. This was achieved by developing design evaluation criteria and costumer competitive assessment, which concluded that Simple Sorting would be designed to be eco- friendly and highly affordable compared to existing products on the market.</p>
      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
      <p class="margin-top-10">To satisfy these requirements Finite Element Analysis was used to determine which material was most suitable for this design and to understand the service life of the product, which came to 10.3 years.
Group Pangea developed a prototype which demonstrated the ability of Simple Sorting to sort different types of waste according to recyclable or non-recyclable. This was achieved with the Google AIY Vision Kit which operates by means of image recognition. An evaluation plan was developed to understand if the final prototype would have met the design criteria establish at the beginning of the project.
Finally, a Manufacturing and Business plan were developed for Simple Sorting, concluding that the manufacturing location would be established in China, the market location would be focused initially at UK universities, and gradually expand to Europe. The financial model estimated that profit is made after the second year of operation by selling bins at a feasible price of £380 with a monthly subscription fee of £15.</p>
